# 🚀 GPTLBank Selenium Automation Project

## 📖 Project Overview
GPTLBank Selenium Automation Project is a robust test automation framework designed to ensure the reliability, security, and efficiency of banking operations in the GPTLBank web application. Leveraging **Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Allure Reporting**, this project automates key functionalities such as **user authentication, account management, and transaction processing** to enhance software quality by identifying defects early and streamlining the testing lifecycle.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objective of this automation framework is to:
- **Ensure system reliability and functional correctness** by automating critical banking operations.
- **Enhance test coverage** across different scenarios, including edge cases and negative testing.
- **Optimize testing efforts** by reducing manual intervention and executing **regression tests** efficiently.
- **Improve reporting and debugging** through **Allure Reports**, offering insightful execution logs and visualized test results.
- **Enable seamless browser interactions** using **Chrome Options** to handle SSL, incognito mode, and notification settings.
- **Adhere to industry best practices** by implementing a scalable and maintainable test automation architecture.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

| Technology/Tool            | Purpose |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **Java**                  | Core programming language for automation scripts |
| **Selenium WebDriver**    | Browser automation for functional and regression testing |
| **TestNG**                | Test framework for managing test execution and reporting |
| **Allure Reports**        | Generates detailed test execution reports with logs and screenshots |
| **TestNG Assertions**     | Validates expected vs actual results in automated test cases |
| **Chrome Options**        | Handles browser configurations such as SSL, incognito mode, and notifications |
| **Maven**                 | Manages dependencies and builds the project efficiently |
| **TestNG XML**            | Defines test execution flow and enables parallel execution |
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | Encapsulates web element interactions for better maintainability |
